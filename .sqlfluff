# The following justifies why we exclude these rules.
# L014:
#    Was changing column names in the following way:
#    - transactionHash -> transactionhash
#    - blockTimestamp  -> blocktimestamp
# L034:
#    Breaks "logical ordering" of columns. E.g. timestamps (typically the leftmost column) were often
#    moved to the middle of the table -> takes extra mental effort when looking at query results.
# L054:
#    We like using column names (i.e. explicit references) on `order by` statements and column indices
#    (i.e. implicit references) on `group by` statements, especially when grouping by 3+ columns.
#    This rule is ignored as it prevents using multiple types of references.
